"body" : "How to create an XM Cloud project in the XM Cloud Deploy app using existing code or a foundation template. Before you begin Ensure that you have an Organization Admin or Organization Owner role in the organization where you want to create a project. In the XM Cloud Deploy app, you create projects and environments, and set up deployment rules for each environment using the project creation wizard interface. The Deploy app supports both Azure DevOps and GitHub for source control. The Deploy app provides templates to help you quickly set up an XM Cloud project. You can use the source code in these templates for the initial deployment to the environment you create for the project. You can also create a project using the Sitecore CLI or the XM Cloud Deploy API . When you create a project, you also create an environment and run an initial deployment to that environment. To create a project using the project creation wizard UI: Log in to the Deploy app . If you are an Organization Admin or Organization Owner in multiple organizations, click the organization where you want to create a project. On the Projects page, click Create project . Enter a name for your project, then click Continue . Choose the source control provider you want to use for your project by clicking Connect , then Continue . If using the XM Cloud template - choose the provider where you want the Deploy app to create a new repository to store your environment code. If using your own source code - choose the provider that contains your customized XM Cloud template repository. Choose the source code that will be used to create your environment. Use XM Cloud template if you want to use an XM Cloud template for your environment's source code. It deploys your authoring and frontend together at the same time, in the same repository. We recommend this option even if you are migrating an existing site. The GitHub repository for the foundation template is available here . Use your own code if you have customized an XM Cloud template repository and want to use this as the source for your project. Choose the source control provider account you want to use. If you want to use an existing source control connection, in the Choose GitHub account or Choose Azure DevOps account drop-down menu, click the account you want to use. If you want to use a new source control connection , click Connect to a new account , and follow the steps to authorize the Deploy app in your account. Â  Choose the repository you want to use. If you are using Azure DevOps as your source control provider, you'll need to choose the Azure DevOps organization and project first. If using the XM Cloud template, enter a name for the new repository, then click Continue . Your repository name can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, or hyphens and a maximum of 100 characters. It must also follow the repository naming convention of your source control provider. If using your own code, choose your customized XM Cloud template repository and the relevant branch, then click Continue . Enter a name for your environment, choose whether the environment is a production environment, and specify if you want to trigger an automatic deployment every time you push to the linked repository branch, then click Continue . A production environment is optimized for production traffic and is covered by the Sitecore SaaS Service Level Agreement . This setting cannot be changed later. Review your configuration, and if everything is set up correctly, click Start deployment . The deployment process then: (If using the XM Cloud template) Creates a new repository in the connected source control account and copies the source code from the selected XM Cloud foundation template to the new repository. Provisions the infrastructure and SaaS tenants to host the Content Management (CM) instance in the environment you defined. Pulls the source code from the repository to a hosted XM Cloud build server and builds the solution. Deploys the XM Cloud build artifacts on the provisioned CM instance. You can use the resulting repository to set up a local development environment . When you create an environment, it appears as an XM Cloud app in the Sitecore Cloud Portal . " }
