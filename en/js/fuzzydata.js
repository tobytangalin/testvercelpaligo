"body" : "If you want the Deploy app to access the GitHub repositories containing your XM Cloud environment code or create repositories in your GitHub account, you need to create a source control connection. When you create a source control connection with GitHub, you have two options:   Install & Authorize  the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app for the selected repositories - choose this option when you have existing code and you want to limit the Deploy app's access to specific GitHub repositories.   Install & Authorize the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app for  All repositories - choose this option if you want the Deploy app to have access to all your GitHub repositories and create repositories on your behalf. Required when you choose the starter foundation in the project creation wizard because XM Cloud Deploy creates a new repository for the starter foundation code. If you want to use the starter foundation while limiting the Deploy app's access to your GitHub repos, you can: Clone the  starter foundation repository . In the Deploy app, create a source control connection for the GitHub account where you cloned the Starter Foundation and  Install & Authorize  the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app for the repository that contains the starter foundation. In the project creation wizard, create a project using existing code and choose the source control connection and repo that you cloned. To create a source control connection with GitHub: On the navigation pane of the Deploy app, click Connections . On the Connections page, click Create connection > GitHub . Choose the GitHub account or organization where you want to install and authorize the Deploy app. Creating a new GitHub connection will install and authorize the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app on your personal account, organization, or enterprise.

If you also want to create projects from the starter foundation , you need to  Install & Authorize the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app for  All repositories . If you are a GitHub Organization member, you must first  Authorize & Request  the Sitecore Deploy GitHub app. Then a GitHub Organization owner must  Approve, Install, & Authorize  your request.
