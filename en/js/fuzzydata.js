"body" : "OAuth access token JWT Create the access token that you need to call the protected APIs in the CM instance. The Sitecore Authoring and Management API and the XM Cloud Deploy API use the  OAuth authorization framework  for security. OAuth allows one program to authorize another program to make changes on behalf of an account holder or end-user. You can also request a JWT for Experience Edge XM using OAuth . To run any operation in the XM Cloud CM instance API, the caller must first obtain an authentication token in JSON Web Token (JWT) format and include it in every call to the CM instance. Following successful authentication, the calling application has access to an access token, which can be used to call the CM instance APIs . OAuth endpoint When requesting a JWT, you must make a POST request to the OAuth endpoint: https:\/\/auth.sitecorecloud.io\/oauth\/token Request headers For the following cURL example, the data is encoded as form data. Therefore the POST request must specify the Content-Type request header with the value application\/x-www-form-urlencoded . Request body When you request a JWT, you must include the client ID and client secret of an automation client generated for the environment that contains the CM instance. The body of the JWT request to the OAuth endpoint must include the following properties: Name Value audience https:\/\/api.sitecorecloud.io grant_type client_credentials client_id The client ID of your automation client. client_secret The client secret of your automation client. Request a token To request an access token for the CM instance APIs, use a POST request. For example, request the JWT using the curl client: curl --request POST --url \"https:\/\/auth.sitecorecloud.io\/oauth\/token\" --header \"content-type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded\" --data audience=https:\/\/api.sitecorecloud.io --data grant_type=client_credentials --data client_id=<your-client-id> --data client_secret=<your-client-secret> You receive the access_token , token_type , and expires_in values. After you enable the GraphQL IDE , you can use the retrieved access token as the Bearer token to authorize the GraphQL IDE or to authorize HTTP requests . Pay attention to the expires_in property of the response because JWTs typically expire in 24 hours. After that time, the token is invalid and you must request a new token. " }
